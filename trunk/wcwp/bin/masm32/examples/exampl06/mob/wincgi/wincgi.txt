      Windows CGI

      Overview

      The Windows CGI interface is a direct interface designed solely for pure 
      Windows backend programs (16 and 32 bits). The purpose of the interface, 
      as touted by O'Reilly, is to make it easy to write extensions in any 
      programming language that can access Windows specific features, such as 
      DDE, OLE and ODBC. The popularity of the Windows CGI interface has 
      declined significantly amidst the current battle of the interfaces. Many 
      scripters have turned either back to Standard CGI or to Perl for 
      portability and support. The Windows CGI interface has its own performance 
      problems as well. It is only suitable for parsing form data.
      Operation
      The server first parses the information from the client and places it into 
      a temporary input file. Other temporary files may also be created during 
      this initial processing. An empty output file is also created at this 
      time. The Windows program is then launched with parameters telling it 
      where to find these files. The program performs its processing and fills 
      the output file with information to send back to the client's browser. 
      When the program terminates, the server parses the output file and sends 
      its contents.

      Four command line parameters are passed to the Windows CGI program:

C:\HTTPD\CGI-WIN\SCRIPT.EXE profile content output query

      The profile parameter is the name of the private profile. It contains 
      information about the launch and may reference other data files. The 
      content parameter is the name of the file that contains data from the 
      user. The output parameter is the name of the output file that the program 
      should write its output to, for return to the client. The query parameter 
      is the query string or URL argument, if available.
      Private Profile
      The profile is formated like a Windows .INI file. The purpose is to allow 
      programs to access the information inside of them easily with the Windows 
      API:

      Section [CGI]
      Each entry works like the environment variables set in the standard CGI 
      interface, for a detailed description see the Standard CGI section. The 
      section CGI contains following entries: 
        REQUEST PROTOCOL name/revision of the protocol used 
        REQUEST METHOD GET, POST or HEAD 
        EXECUTEABLE PATH logical path of the CGI program 
        LOGICAL PATH additional path information if needed by the script 
        PHYSICAL PATH the logical path with aliases expanded 
        QUERY STRING the information in the URL after the question mark 
        REFERER URL of the document that includes the CGI call 
        FROM if set by the client: the email address of the user 
        CONTENT TYPE MIME type of attachment if existing 
        CONTENT LENGTH attachment length 
        CONTENT FILE name of attachment file 
        SERVER SOFTWARE name/version of webserver i.e. Alibaba/1.0 
        SERVER NAME host name of the server 
        SERVER PORT internet port number used 
        SERVER ADMIN email address of the administrator 
        CGI VERSION 'CGI/1.3a' for this version 
        REMOTE HOST host name of the client 
        REMOTE ADDRESS IP address of the client 
        AUTHENTICATION METHOD 'BASIC' method used for authenticating CGI access 
        AUTHENTICATION REALM which group of users is allowed access 
        AUTHENTICATED USERNAME username within realm 

      Section [ACCEPT]
      All accept fields received are written in the form accept=quality
      1 is assumed if not stated otherwise 
Example:

[ACCEPT]
text/plain=1.00
text/html=1.00
audio/x-aiff=1.00
audio/basic=1.00
*/*=1.00

      Section [SYSTEM]
        GMT OFFSET number of seconds the local time differs from GMT. This is a 
        positive value for regions east of Greenwich (Europe, Asia), a negative 
        for regions westwards (USA) 
        DEBUG MODE normally set to zero 
        CONTENT FILE is the private profile ini filename. 
        OUTPUT FILE the name of the output file sent to the client. 

      Section [EXTRA HEADERS]
      Here all values retrieved by a get command are included, in name=value 
      manner. 

      Example:

        [EXTRAHEADERS]
        var1=Value_1
        var2=Value_2 

      Section [FORM LITERAL]
      Here all values retrieved by a POST command are included, in name=value 
      manner. In this section we place all values which are less then 1500 
      bytes, if they are longer, they are put into section [FORM EXTERNAL]. 

      Section [FORM EXTERNAL]
      Here all values retrieved by a POST command are included, in name=filename 
      size manner. The files contain the values without any modification. Be 
      sure to read them with binary file attributes, so that no automatic 
      conversion takes place. 

      Example:

        NAME_VAR=c:\tmp/03147835.0 181777 

      Section [FORM HUGE]
      If a string in the content file is more than 64kB, it is referenced here 
      in the form name=offset length. Offset points to the beginning of the 
      string in the content file and length is the size of the string. Both 
      values are in bytes. Be sure to open the content file in binary mode, so 
      that no automatic conversion takes place.
