The MsgParam addin for RadASM displays information about the wParam and 
lParam parameters of message-dispatching functions, as well as providing
autocomplete for constant values of the two parameters.


Behaviour:
Whenever you call a message-dispatching function with a known message, a
tooltip will show information about the wParam and lParam  parameters for 
that specific message. Also if wParam or lParam are constant values, a 
list will be displayed indicating possible constant values.


Notes:
The MsgParam.msg file contains the information about messages in the
following format:
Result=MESSAGE,wparamVal[const1,const2,...],lparamVal[const1,const2,...]
"Result=" and [const1,const2,...] are optional.
