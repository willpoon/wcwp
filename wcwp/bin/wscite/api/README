			lua5api for scite

Lua 5 API files for SciTE. The source for the material is Lua 5.0.2.

========================================================================
NOTE (20100802) As you can see from the date, this is terribly ancient.
I seem to recall someone posting a 5.1 version on the SciTE list, but
I can't seem to find the thing right now...

FILES

You will most probably be using lua5.api and lualib5_annot.api. The
file lualib5.api is a list of just the Lua calls, without explanatory
annotations.

	README			this file...
	lua5.api		Lua C API calls
	lualib5.api		Lua calls without annotations
	lualib5_annot.api	Lua calls with annotations

The following are the raw, unsorted material created from the Lua manual
and C header files. You won't need them unless you want to rework the
files from the original material.

	lua5_raw.api		unsorted stuff made from C header files
	lualib5_raw.api		unsorted stuff made from manual.html
	lualib5_annot_raw.api	unsorted stuff made from manual.html

Copy the appropriate API files to your SciTE data folder. Alternatively,
you can place them in a separate location and specify the appropriate path
to the files in the property files.

SETTING UP THE API FILES ON SCITE

To set up Lua C API calls, add the following to cpp.properties:

	api.$(file.patterns.cpp)=$(SciteDefaultHome)/lua5.api
	calltip.cpp.end.definition=)

To set up Lua calls, add the following to lua.properties:

	api.$(file.patterns.lua)=$(SciteDefaultHome)/lualib5_annot.api
	calltip.lua.word.characters=.:$(word.chars.lua)
	calltip.lua.end.definition=)

Note: don't add these lines at the very top of the file, because some
parameters that are used need to be defined first, e.g. file.patterns.cpp.

Note: you can also set up autocompletion, but personally I don't use the
autocompletion feature, so I can't really help you on that.
